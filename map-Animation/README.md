# Map-Animation

## Description: 
This simulation presents a map of Boston City. Upon uploading on the live browser, a display of a bus icon representing a live bus in route, will appear. 

## How to run: 
First must have own access token to implement into the code. Navigate to [MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Here you will create an account. Next, go to [Access Tokens](https://account.mapbox.com/access-tokens/). Select 'Create a token'. Copy token and keep handy.

Clone repository and add your access token to the top of the .js scripts file replacing the '#' in mapboxgl.accessToken = '#'. This should allow the code to run in browser as built. 

## Future improvements:
Add more dynamic components to the page that increases the user interaction.
Add routes and detailed popups for bus schedule.
