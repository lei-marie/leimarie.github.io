# Pac-Men

## Description: 
This is a game of creating several PacMen with the click of a button. Placed in  random start positions, the simulation begins with the click of the 'Start Game'.This triggers the PacMen to move at random speed. Positions of each PacMan are tracked in the duration of the game, as to reverse direction when colliding with edge of the window.
