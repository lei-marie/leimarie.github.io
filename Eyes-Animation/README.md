# Eyes-Animation

## Description: 
Created a simple dynamic page via the DOM with manipulation of HTML, CSS and Javascript. Implemented a mouse event where its movement synchronizes with the movement of two eyes that are displayed on the page. These two eyes were created via CSS and whose position is updated with each mousemove.

## How to run: 
Three ways: 1) Clone the repository and run it on your local device. 2) Copy and paste link 3) Click here

## Roadmap of future improvements:
Add more dynamic components to the page that increases the user interaction.
